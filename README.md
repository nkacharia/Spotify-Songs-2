# Spotify-Songs-2

After successfully implementing a basic Spotify app,  I decided to elevate the
app's features and incorporate additional functionality.

The new envisioned design of my app comprises three main screens:

Song List Screen: Initially created as a component of 'Spotify Songs', this screen displays a song list, closely mirroring the interface of the Spotify app.

Detailed Song View Screen: By tapping into the Spotify API, this screen is designed to present users with extensive details about their selected song, diving deeper into its attributes. The Spotify API provides the URL for this screen, and it's my responsibility to effortlessly integrate this content into a distinct screen within the app.

Playback Screen: In a similar vein, utilizing the capabilities of the Spotify API, I planned to develop a playback screen. The API supplies the essential URL to activate this feature, ensuring users can indulge in a fluid and captivating auditory experience.

With the application of the StackNavigator, my objective became to weave these screens together, ensuring a smooth transition between them. The end goal was to present a user-centric, feature-dense Spotify app adaptable to a range of user preferences. My decision to expand the app highlights my dedication to offering a polished and thorough music streaming experience.
